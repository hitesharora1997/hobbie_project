# Client-Server-Communication-using-Socket-Programming-           

▪ Socket are basically used for inter process communication within single or over a network system. So sockets are basically two endpoints of the communication via which we can communicate. So socket represents a single connection between exactly two pieces of software but we can also communicate between multiple pieces of software but this requires multiple sockets.
            ▪ AF_UNIX: Process the requests of requesting clients by creating file system socket and establish connection between client and server in multi-threading environment.
            ▪ AF_INET: Created AF_INET sockets and connect all requesting clients with server both through loop back address on same machine and through IP address over same network on two system using threads and mutex.
