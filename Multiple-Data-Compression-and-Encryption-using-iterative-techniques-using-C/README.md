# Multiple-Data-Compression-and-Encryption-using-iterative-techniques-using-C
Encryption of compressed file is done so that unauthorised user cannot understand and verified that data compressed successfully.


        Encryption of compressed file is done so that unauthorised user cannot understand it. Data is compressed using code length and index of the master array then it is saved encrypted file ,encrypt file has newer bit pattern and lower size which proved that data is  compressed.
        Same file is then decompressed using same master array original data is obtained which  verified that data compressed successfully.
        ◦ The project aims to remove ASCII code based data redundancy in the provided source file  so as to trim the entire file and at the same time encode it with our algorithm in order to encrypt the data.
        ◦ We are concerned with the 8-bit extended ASCII character set, so we will have a maximum of 256 characters, and hence 8 different types of algorithmic procedures.
        ◦ We create following function to solve this problem: Compression, Decompression,Master array, Find index, Unique array etc.
